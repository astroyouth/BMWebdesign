          <h1>How much does it cost to get a good website?</h1>
        <p>        
            Agencies will often be cagey about the potential cost of a project and insist on a lot of up-front discussion and back and forth before committing to a pricing agreement which maximises their potential profit from a new customer. BM Web design prefers to be up front with project costing in an effort to be as candid as possible. There may be aspects of projects that occasionally pop up that will cause additional costs but they are few and far between and we will always be frank and honest if this does happen. Being upfront about scope-creep will be our promise to you.

        <h2>How much does a website cost in these days?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            You can expect to pay between £2,500 – £5,000 for a bespoke brochure site built on a CMS like WordPress. The cost will be less if the website is simpler and, naturally, it will be more if you need to add the capability of managing a database of users and or products for an online shop.

            But, surely I can work out how to do it myself?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Firstly, don’t call me surely. But yes, there are plenty of platforms out there that can build your site seemingly “for free”. WIx and Squarespace spring to mind and were where I cut my teeth on Web Design. However, if my first website build was anything to go by, it was a slow and painful learning experience when I could have been working on more important things.  
        </p>
        <p>
            You may well be in a similar position. Are you going to have the time, energy and resources needed to take a step away from running your business to learn these new skills? I suspect not, so allow me to take on that burden since I’ve already gone through that learning curve.

          <h2>What are the different types of websites?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Usually, the type of website you require depends on your needs, these can usually be broken down into:</p>
          <dl>
              <dt>Static Sites & Landing Pages</dt>
              <dd>- These just sit there on the internet informing your visitors about what you do or offer and perhaps have a call to action to use a phone number or Email address to get in touch.</dd>
              <dt>CMS (Content Management System) sites </dt>
              <dd>- If you need a website that allows users to create profiles, submit comments or anything where information from them needs to be stored and used in some way then a CMS site is what you are after. </dd>
              <dt>eCommerce Sites.</dt>
              <dd>- As well as managing user’s information your sight might also need to manage a database of products like an online shop. In which case and eCommerce platform is what you are going to need. Depending on the size of your online offering, these sites can become very large and involved.</dd>

        <p>If you do some research you will find a broad range of pricing and I have taken the time to ensure that our pricing is competitive as we can make it. If you compare our pricing profile to large agencies, you will find we are asking for about half of what they might charge. </p>

        <p>Depending on the amount of the work a typical bespoke website will take between 4 – 8 weeks to complete. This can be either quicker or longer depending on if designs require multiple iterations or it there’s any scope creep. It is also advisable for you to have as much of your content (like company/people profiles, service descriptions ect..) ready
